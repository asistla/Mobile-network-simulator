Simulates a 3 sectored antenna base station. 
Antenna parameters are obtained from the file antenna_pattern.txt. This is basically a plot of the power vs the azimuth angles.
These parameters are usually published in datasheets of specific antenna modules. If you want to try this out for a different antenna type, just use the appropriate antenna pattern file.
